 I am a javascript developer, mainly specialize on the front-end of things.
Sometimes, I can tackle a bit of backend, like NodeJs, if it suits my current goal.

My current tech stack is:

* Typescript/Javascript
* React/Redux or Angular
* Nodejs on the backend w/express
* Mongo for database

 This is the stack, that I'm comfortable with, and I always try to find time to explore other technologies as well. At this point graphql is of interest to me, I run this personal website on gatsby (static site generator).
