I am a full-stack javascript developer, mainly specialize on the front-end of things. 
But I also deal with backend, like NodeJs or anything else, that might suit my current goal.
My current tech stack is:

* Typescript/Javascript
* React/Redux
* Nodejs on the backend w/express
* Mongo for database

This is the stack, that I'm comfortable with, but currently I explore other technologies as well, such as graphql is of interest to me, I run this personal website on gatsby (static site generator).

I'm also interested in algorithms and data structures, sometimes I would do coding challenges, currently I'm going through a course on algorithms and data structure on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome). You have to use Java for programming assignments, which is a pain on it's own, kind of :).

Other than that my hobbies are learning to play guitar, TV shows, and just learning something new in general.
